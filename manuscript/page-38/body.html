Why do you put my husband in a passion?</p><p>Toi. (<em>in a soft tone</em>). I, Madam? Alas! I don't know what you mean, and my only aim is to please master in everything.</p><p>Arg.

I told him that I thought the match very advantageous for her, but that I believed he would do better to put her in a convent.</p><p>Bel. There is not much harm in that, and I think that she is right.</p><p>Arg. Ah! deary, do you believe her? She is a vile girl, and has said a hundred insolent things to me.</p></div> </div>
