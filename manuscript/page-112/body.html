<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ber. Your wife doesn't fail to advise you to get rid, in that way, of your two daughters; and I have no doubt that, through a spirit of charity, she would be charmed to see them both good nuns.</p><p>Arg. Oh, I see! My poor wife again! It is she who does all the harm, and everybody is against her.</p><p>Ber. No, brother; let us leave that alone. She is a woman with the best intentions in the world for the good of your family, and is free from all interested motives. She expresses for you the most extraordinary tenderness, and shows towards your children an inconceivable goodness. No, don't let us speak of her, but only of your daughter. What can be your reason for wishing to give her in marriage to the sort of a doctor?</p><p>Arg. My reason is that I wish to have a son-in-law who will suit my wants.</p><p>Ber. But it is not what your daughter requires, and we have a more suitable match for her.</p></div> </div>
