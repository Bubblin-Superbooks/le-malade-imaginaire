What is the matter with you, dear Angélique, and what misfortune makes you weep?</p><p>Ang. Alas! I weep for what was most dear and most precious to me. I weep for the death of my father.</p><p>Cle. O heaven! what a misfortune! What an unforeseen stroke of fortune! Alas! after I had asked your uncle to ask you in marriage, I was coming to see him, in order to try by my respect and entreaties to incline his heart to grant you to my wishes.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Ang. Ah! Cléante, let us talk no more of this. Let us give up all hopes of marriage. Now my father is dead, I will have nothing to do with the world, and will renounce it for ever. Yes, my dear father, if I resisted your will, I will at least follow out one of your intentions, and will by that make amends for the sorrow</p></div> </div>
