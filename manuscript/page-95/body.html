My step-mamma told me to come to you.</p><p>Arg. Yes; come here. Come nearer. Turn round, and hold up your head. Look straight at me. Well?</p><p>Lou. What, papa?</p><p>Arg. So?</p><p>Lou. What?</p><p>Arg. Have you nothing to say to me?</p><p>Lou. Yes. I will, to amuse you, tell you, if you like, the story of the Ass's Skin or the fable of the Fox and the Crow, which I have learnt lately.</p><p>Arg. That is not what I want of you.</p><p>Lou. What is it then?</p><p>Arg. Ah! cunning little girl, you know very well what I mean.</p></div> </div>
