Come, come, I am your servant; I'm in no joking humour.</p><p>Arg. What is the matter?</p><p>Toi. Your doctor, forsooth, who wanted to feel my pulse!</p><p>Arg. Just imagine; and that, too, at fourscore and ten years of age.</p><p>Ber. Now, I say, brother, since you have quarrelled with Mr. Purgon, won't you give me leave to speak of the match which is proposed for my niece?</p><p>Arg. No, brother; I will put her in a convent, since she has rebelled against me. I see plainly that there is some love business at the bottom of it all, and I have discovered a certain secret interview which they don't suspect me to know anything about.</p></div> </div>
