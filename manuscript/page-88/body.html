<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ang. We all have our own end in marrying. For my part, as I only want a husband that I can love sincerely, and as I intend to consecrate my whole life to him, I feel bound, I confess, to be cautious. There are some who marry simply to free themselves from the yoke of their parents, and to be at liberty to do all they like. There are others, Madam, who see in marriage only a matter of mere interest; who marry only to get a settlement, and to enrich themselves by the death of those they marry. They pass without scruple from husband to husband, with an eye to their possessions. These, no doubt, Madam, are not so difficult to satisfy, and care little what the husband is like.</p><p>Bel. You are very full of reasoning to-day. I wonder what you mean by this.</p><p>Ang. I, Madam? What can I mean but what I say?</p><p>Bel. You are such a simpleton, my dear, that one can hardly bear with you.</p></div> </div>
