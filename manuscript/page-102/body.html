Ah! very bad, brother; very bad.</p><p>Ber. How is that?</p><p>Arg. No one would believe how very feeble I am.</p><p>Ber. That's a sad thing, indeed.</p><p>Arg. I have hardly enough strength to speak.</p><p>Ber. I came here, brother, to propose a match for my niece, Angélique.</p><p>Arg. (<em>in a rage, speaking with great fury, and starting up from his chair</em>). Brother, don't speak to me of that wicked, good-for-nothing, insolent, brazen-faced girl. I will put her in a convent before two days are over.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Ber. Ah! all right! I am glad to see that you have a little strength still left, and that my visit does you good.</p></div> </div>
