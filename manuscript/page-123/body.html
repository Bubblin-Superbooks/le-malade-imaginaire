What are you going to do?</p><p>Arg. To take this little clyster; it will soon be done.</p><p>Ber. Are you joking? Can you not spend one moment without clysters or physic? Put it off to another time, and be quiet.</p><p>Arg. Mr. Fleurant, let it be for to-night or to-morrow morning.</p><p>Mr. Fleu. (<em>to</em> Béralde). What right have you to interfere? How dare you oppose yourself to the prescription of the doctors, and prevent the gentleman from taking my clyster? You are a nice fellow to show such boldness.</p><p>Ber. Go, Sir, go; it is easy to see that you are not accustomed to speak face to face with men.</p></div> </div>
