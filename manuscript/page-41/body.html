(<em>throwing himself in his chair</em>). Ah! I can hold out no longer.</p><p>Bel. But why do you fly into such a passion? she thought she was doing right.</p><p>Arg. You don't know, darling, the wickedness of that villainous baggage. She has altogether upset me, and I shall want more than eight different mixtures and twelve injections to remedy the evil.</p><p>Bel. Come, come, my dearie, compose yourself a little.</p><p>Arg. Lovey, you are my only consolation.</p><p>Bel. Poor little pet!</p><p>Arg. To repay you for all the love you have for me, my darling, I will, as I told you, make my will.</p></div> </div>
