I know what you mean, Madam, and how kind you are to me; but it may be hoped that your advice may not be fortunate enough to be followed.</p><p>Bel. That is because well-brought-up and good children, like you, scorn to be obedient to the will of their fathers. Obedience was all very well in former times.</p><p>Ang. The duty of a daughter has its limits, Madam, and neither reason nor law extend it to all things.</p><p>Bel. Which means that your thoughts are all in favour of marriage, but that you will choose a husband for yourself.</p><p>Ang. If my father will not give me a husband I like, at least I beseech him not to force me to marry one I can never love.</p><p>Arg. Gentlemen, I beg your pardon for all this.</p></div> </div>
