Sir, I beg your pardon with all my heart.</p><p>Arg. (<em>to</em> Béralde). It is wonderful.</p><p>Toi. You will not take amiss, I hope, the curiosity I feel to see such an illustrious patient; and your reputation, which reaches the farthest ends of the world, must be my excuse for the liberty I am taking.</p><p>Arg. Sir, I am your servant.</p><p>Toi. I see, Sir, that you are looking earnestly at me. What age do you think I am?</p><p>Arg. I should think twenty-six or twenty-seven at the utmost.</p><p>Toi. Ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! I am ninety years old.</p><p>Arg. Ninety years old!</p><p>Toi. Yes; this is what the secrets of my art have done for me to preserve me fresh and vigorous as you see.</p></div> </div>
