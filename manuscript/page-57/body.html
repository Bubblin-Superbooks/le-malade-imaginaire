Do not speak so loud, for fear of splitting open the head of Mr. Argan.</p><p>Cle. Sir, I am delighted to find you up, and to see you better.</p><p>Toi. (<em>affecting to be angry</em>). How! better? It is false; master is always ill.</p><p>Cle. I had heard that your master was better, and I think that he looks well in the face.</p><p>Toi. What do you mean by his looking well in the face? He looks very bad, and it is only impertinent folks who say that he is better; he never was so ill in his life.</p><p>Arg. She is right.</p><p>Toi. He walks, sleeps, eats, and drinks, like other folks, but that does not hinder him from being very ill.</p></div> </div>
