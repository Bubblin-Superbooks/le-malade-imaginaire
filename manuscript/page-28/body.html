Very well, then, Sir, you are ill; don't let us quarrel about that. Yes, you are very ill, I agree with you upon that point, more ill even than you think. Now, is that settled? But your daughter is to marry a husband for herself, and as she is not ill, what is the use of giving her a doctor?</p><p>Arg. It is for my sake that I give her this doctor, and a good daughter ought to be delighted to marry for the sake of her father's health.</p><p>Toi. In good troth, Sir, shall I, as a friend, give you a piece of advice?</p><p>Arg. What is this advice?</p><p>Toi. Not to think of this match.</p><p>Arg. And your reason?</p><p>Toi. The reason is that your daughter will never consent to it.</p></div> </div>
