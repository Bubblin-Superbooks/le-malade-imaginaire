I say, Angélique, I have a piece of news for yon which, perhaps, you did not expect. You have been asked of me in marriage. Halloa! how is that? You are smiling. It is pleasant, is it not, that word marriage? there is nothing so funny to young girls. Ah! nature! nature! So, from what I see, daughter, there is no need of my asking you if you are willing to marry.</p><p>Ang. I ought to obey you in everything, father.</p><p>Arg. I am very glad to possess such an obedient daughter; the thing is settled then, and I have promised you.</p><p>Ang. It is my duty, father, blindly to follow all you determine upon for me.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Arg. My wife, your mother-in-law, wanted me to make a nun of you and of your little sister Louison also.</p></div> </div>
