Very willingly, Sir, if it is all that is required to become your son-in-law. I will turn doctor; apothecary also, if you like. It is not such a difficult thing after all, and I would do much more to obtain from you the fair Angélique.</p><p>Ber. But, brother, it just strikes me; why don't you turn doctor yourself? It would be much more convenient to have all you want within yourself.</p><p>Toi. Quite true. That is the very way to cure yourself. There is no disease bold enough to dare to attack the person of a doctor.</p><p>Arg. I imagine, brother, that you are laughing at me. Can I study at my age?</p><p>Ber. Study! What need is there? You are clever enough for that; there are a great many who are not a bit more clever than you are.</p></div> </div>
