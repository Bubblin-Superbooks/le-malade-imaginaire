I am greatly obliged to you, Sir, for the kind intentions you have towards me.</p><p>Toi. Let me feel your pulse. Come, come, beat properly, please. Ah! I will soon make you beat as you should. This pulse is trifling with me; I see that it does not know me yet. Who is your doctor?</p><p>Arg. Mr. Purgon.</p><p>Toi. That man is not noted in my books among the great doctors. What does he say you are ill of?</p><p>Arg. He says it is the liver, and others say it is the spleen.</p><p>Toi. They are a pack of ignorant blockheads; you are suffering from the lungs.</p><p>Arg. The lungs?</p><p>Toi. Yes; what do you feel?</p><p>Arg. From time to time great pains in my head.</p></div> </div>
